**[Introduction]** <br />
Project targeted at reborn of former former greatness of Unix. This free distribution of Unix v7th port by Nordier to i386 will be updated with my own drivers... and will make Unix suitable for using on desktops and server platforms. <br />
<br />
The project can exist only because of Robert Nordier (https://www.nordier.com/), who ported original Unix V7 to i386 machine in 1999-2006. <br />
<br />
**[Our target]** <br />
To have 10% of www-servers and 1% of desktop computers running Unix at 2030th year.<br /> 
So we will:<br />
  * Port software to Unix V7th.
  * Write drivers for USB, IP/TCP Networking, Modern File systems.
  * Create package manager for Unix and for Linux and for... windows probably.
  * Write our own graphic driver.
  * create Desktop Enviroment for Unix.
